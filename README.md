## Introduction

The Robo Gold Forex Software is an automated trading system designed to analyze Forex market trends and execute trades based on profitable opportunities. The code provided here serves as an example implementation of the software's core functionality.

## Installation

To use the Robo Gold Forex Software, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary libraries: Trade.mqh and Timeseries.mqh.
2. Set the desired constant values for lot size, stop loss, and take profit.
3. Implement the required functions (OnTick, CheckTrend, OpenBuyTrade, OpenSellTrade, OnTrade, OnMarketChange, OnError, OnSecurity, OnDataFeed, OnTesting, OnDocumentation, OnDelivery, OnCollaboration, OnCodingStandards, OnInit) according to your trading strategy and requirements.

## Usage

The main entry point function, `OnTick()`, checks if the market is open and calls the `CheckTrend()` function to analyze Forex market trends. Based on the trend analysis, it opens a buy trade or a sell trade using the `OpenBuyTrade()` or `OpenSellTrade()` functions, respectively.

The `CheckTrend()` function should be implemented with your custom trend analysis logic. It should return `true` if the trend is up, and `false` otherwise.

The `OpenBuyTrade()` and `OpenSellTrade()` functions calculate the entry price, stop loss level, and take profit level based on the current market prices. They use the `CTrade` class to execute the trade.

Other functions such as `OnTrade()`, `OnMarketChange()`, `OnError()`, `OnSecurity()`, `OnDataFeed()`, `OnTesting()`, `OnDocumentation()`, `OnDelivery()`, `OnCollaboration()`, `OnCodingStandards()`, and `OnInit()` can be implemented as needed to handle trade execution, market changes, errors, security, data feeds, testing, documentation, delivery, collaboration, and coding standards.
